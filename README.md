# Congenica plugin to retrieve PID (Personal Identifier Data)

## Development setup

This repository uses ParcelJS for task automation, bundling and:

- ESLint for linting the source JavaScript files
- Babel for transpiling of ES6 to ES5
- JS minifications

You should be able to install all dependencies by running `npm nstall` from the project root.

This also provides a test page `index.html` which is used for debugging.
